### Meneely et al. Metrics Scripts
#### These scripts where created by me in order to answer some research question for my research based on some samples Meneely et. al. provided and their descriptions
> How to
- Simple run the scripts in bash
  - Example: `bash nea.sh`
- The results will be avaliable in a `.out` file in the script folder
- Note 1: Remember to put the commits hashes in the `hashes.txt` file
